            <p>I'm Meelad Raza, a dedicated learner from Pakistan currently pursuing full-stack web development.
    My journey began with a passion for creating websites and understanding how the internet works.
    I'm currently studying at Saylani Mass IT Training (Batch 17), where I'm building strong front-end skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, before moving into backend technologies like Node.js and MongoDB.
My goal is to become a professional MERN stack developer by next year, Insha’Allah.
    I'm also deeply connected to Islamic studies, as I believe that knowledge of both Deen and Duniya creates a balanced, meaningful life.
    With every line of code, I'm not just building projects — I'm building my future.</p>
